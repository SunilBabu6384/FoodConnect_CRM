PROJECT TITLE:      To Supply Leftover Food to Poor

This project is designed to address food waste reduction and hunger alleviation by redistributing surplus food to those in need. 
The goal is to implement a sustainable solution using logistics and community partnerships to efficiently collect, manage,
  and distribute leftover food from restaurants, events, and households to shelters and individuals experiencing food insecurity. 
Through this project, we aim to improve food availability for low-income communities, reduce food waste, and support humanitarian goals.
